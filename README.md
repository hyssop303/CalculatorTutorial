# CalculatorTutorial
helloworld b4 calculator

This was built on my computer VS C++ 2019, guided by this tutorial docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/get-started/tutorial-console-cpp?view=msvc-160
The tutorial's console automatically generated hello world, which ran, 
but when I pasted the tutorial's calculator code into my VS 2019 hello world code, it wouldn't compile.

So to troubleshoot simple tutorial, without following directions, from VS2019 Team Explorer, I signed into github.
I'm trying saving generic working hello world to github, then sync seemed to put some code in github.
Next I'll put tutorial's calculator code in a different branch on github, that produces compile errors on my computer on VS2019.
