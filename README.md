# CalculatorTutorial
helloworld b4 calculator

This was built on my computer VS C++ 2019, guided by this tutorial docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/get-started/tutorial-console-cpp?view=msvc-160
The tutorial's console automatically generated hello world, which ran, 
but when I pasted the tutorial's calculator code into my VS 2019 hello world code, it wouldn't compile.

So to troubleshoot simple tutorial, without following directions, from VS2019 Team Explorer, I signed into github.
I'm trying saving generic working hello world to github, then sync seemed to put some code in github.
Next I'll put tutorial's calculator code in a different branch on github, that produces compile errors on my computer on VS2019.

These directions are slightly different I found morning 11/4/2020, may include more on installer so I'll recheck.

Troubleshooting, prereq says Have Visual Studio with the Desktop development with C++ workload installed and running on your computer. If it's not installed yet, see Install C++ support in Visual Studio. Prerequisite Desktop development with C++ should contain a link to show what it looks like.  I clicked on your 'see Install C++ support in Visual Studio link, and the only 'desktop'  it shows is .net desktop development.  .net desktop development was not available in my install, and I have the screenshot to prove it of what I selected in the installer, but it seems to be running fine. But now I see a scroll down that I probably didn't do, of probably a bunch more workloads, so I'll try installing again, to look for desktop workload.
